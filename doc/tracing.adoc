[[tracing]]
=== Tracing utilities

[[trace_objects]]
* *trace_objects*(_boolean_) +
[small]#Enable/disable tracing of objects creation and destruction (which by default
is disabled). +
If enabled, a printf is generated whenever an object is created or deleted,
indicating the object type and the value of its raw LibSndFile handle.#

////
[[now]]
* _t_ = *now*(&nbsp;) +
[small]#Returns the current time in seconds (a Lua number). +
This is implemented with monotonic _clock_gettime(3)_, if available, or 
with _gettimeofday(3)_ otherwise.#

[[since]]
* _dt_ = *since*(_t_) +
[small]#Returns the time in seconds (a Lua number) elapsed since the time _t_, 
previously obtained with the <<now, now>>(&nbsp;) function.#
